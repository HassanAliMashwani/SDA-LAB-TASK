## Introduction
This project aims to explore the evolution of software architectures, focusing on the .NET Framework and Netflix. It highlights the major features, architectural diagrams, and the role of programming languages in their development.

## Reports

### .NET Framework Evolution
- **Release Timeline:**
  1. **.NET Framework 1.0 (2002)**
     - Major Features:
       - Introduced the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
       - Base Class Library (BCL) with foundational features.
       - Support for Windows Forms and ASP.NET Web Forms.
       - Primary programming language: C#.
  
  2. **.NET Framework 2.0 (2005)**
     - Major Features:
       - Generics for type safety and performance.
       - Improved ASP.NET with new controls and features.
       - 64-bit support.
  
  3. **.NET Framework 4.0 (2010)**
     - Major Features:
       - Parallel programming support.
       - Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR).
       - ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework.
  
  4. **.NET Core 1.0 (2016)**
     - Major Features:
       - Cross-platform support.
       - Modular architecture.
  
  5. **.NET 6 (2021)**
     - Major Features:
       - Unified platform for all workloads.
       - Native AOT compilation.

### Netflix Architecture Evolution
- **Architecture Timeline:**
  1. **Early Architecture (Monolithic)**
     - Challenges: Scalability limitations and maintenance complexity.
  
  2. **Transition to Cloud**
     - Migration to AWS in 2011 enabled scalability and reliability.
  
  3. **Current Architecture (Microservices)**
     - Fully microservices-based architecture with hundreds of loosely coupled services.
     - Use of Open Connect CDN to optimize video delivery.
